To test:

Start from the solution within the CSE445_Assignment6 folder/project.

The CSE445_Assignment6.SercurityLib is another project used in the main project(CSE445_Assignment6) but implemented separately for practice. You do not need to do anything extra with this .SecurityLib folder to make it functional as long as it is in the same directory as the main folder(CSE445_Assignment6).
